## Problem
The age-old dilemma: "Is my crush considered gorgeous?" This question often leads to endless debates among friends and acquaintances. In our case, me and my group mate found ourselves in a heated discussion trying to determine if a girl in our group was generally considered gorgeous.

## Solution
Introducing the Hit or Miss API: a unique solution that lets AI settle these debates for us. Utilizing advanced image recognition and beauty standards algorithms, this API analyzes photos to give an impartial assessment.

## How It Works
1. **Upload a Photo:** Users upload a photo of the person in question.
2. **AI Analysis:** The API uses a combination of facial recognition, feature analysis, and cultural beauty standards to evaluate the photo.
3. **Receive Assessment:** The API returns a "Hit" or "Miss" verdict, along with a percentage score indicating the confidence level of the assessment.

## Features
- **Impartial Judgement:** Removes human bias from the equation.
- **Advanced Algorithms:** Incorporates the latest in AI and machine learning for accurate assessments.
- **Confidentiality and Privacy:** Ensures that all uploaded photos are treated with utmost confidentiality and privacy.
- **Simple and User-Friendly:** Easy-to-use interface for quick and hassle-free evaluations. (I'm not sure yet, you need to ask the second contributor (Danny) about that)

## Use Case
This API is perfect for settling friendly disputes, satisfying curiosity, or even as an aid in social experiments related to perceptions of beauty.
